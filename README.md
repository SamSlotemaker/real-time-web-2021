## Assignment 1

### Description
An application where you can find a Warzone team on your desired platform, when you are looking for that missing team member.

### Concept

#### Login
Users need to login with thier call of duty info
* Username
* Platform

This is to authenticate real accounts and so stats can be portrayed when they are chatting.

The idea is to show something like:
``` 
User123
KD: 1.01 Wins: 10 Platform: Playstation
Hey i'm user123
````

#### Chatting
Users can chat with other users, when they are looking for a team. I want to make a few standard options users can send, like: 
_'Looking for +2, minimal KD: 1.5, minimal wins: 50'_

#### Show detailed stats
I want to make an option which sends a 'card' with a detailed overview of a player stats, with a button or with a '!stats' command, so users can show other players how good they are. It could be an idea to do something similar with recent matches. 

#### Chat history 
Users need to see old chats from when they weren't online, so they can still see other people who recently asked for a team. Preferably with a time stamp from when they were send
